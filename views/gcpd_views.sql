-- simple views
create view officer_assignments_view as 
	select * from officers left join assignments using (officer_id);
	
	select * from officer_assignments_view;
	select case_id, first_name, last_name from officer_assignments_view where rank ~* 'captain';
	
-- alternate table as view (issues w/ this approach...)
create table officer_assignments_tbl as 
	select * from officers left join assignments using (officer_id);
	
	
-- need to specify fields because ambiguous field names; must differentiate
create view officer_units_view as 
	select officers.officer_id, officers.first_name, officers.last_name, officers.rank, 
		officers.joined_gcpd_on, officers.active AS "active officer", 
		units.unit_id, units.name, units.active AS "active unit"

-- can join views 
select * from officer_assignments_view join officer_units_view using (officer_id);
  -- rarely used, not a great idea to create new views of joined views...


-- grand view won't work b/c of ambiguous fields, so ...

		officers.officer_id, officers.first_name, officers.last_name, officers.rank,
